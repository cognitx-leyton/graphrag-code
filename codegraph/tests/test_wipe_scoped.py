"""Tests for :meth:`codegraph.loader.Neo4jLoader.wipe_scoped`.

The 3-step delete cascade is already covered by ``test_loader_pairing.py``
via :meth:`delete_file_subgraph`. These tests focus on the new behaviour:

- Empty package list → no-op, no driver session opened.
- Selects file paths by ``f.package IN $packages``.
- Delegates path deletion to :meth:`delete_file_subgraph`.
- Drops orphaned ``:Package`` nodes for the wiped packages.

Driver / session / Cypher are all mocked so no Neo4j is required.
