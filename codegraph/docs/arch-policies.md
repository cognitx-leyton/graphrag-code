# Architecture-Conformance Policies

Reference for the four built-in policies run by `codegraph arch-check` and the `/arch-check` slash command. Each section covers: what the policy detects, why the invariant matters, the exact Cypher, how to interpret a violation, and common false positives.

If a policy fires on your PR and you believe it shouldn't, read the "False positives" subsection first — most violations are either load-bearing bugs or one of the known noise patterns, and the doc flags which is which.

## 1. `import_cycles`

### What it detects

File-level import cycles of length 2-6. A cycle is a sequence of `:File` nodes connected by `:IMPORTS` edges that returns to its starting point:

```cypher
MATCH path = (a:File)-[:IMPORTS*2..6]->(a)
RETURN [n IN nodes(path) | n.path] AS cycle, length(path) AS hops
```

### Why it matters

Import cycles make modules untestable in isolation, break tree-shaking, and pin code into tight coupling that's expensive to split later. In Python they cause `ImportError` when the cycle is forced into different import orders; in TypeScript they silently turn exports into `undefined` at load time. Either way: they're almost never intentional.

### Interpreting a violation

Each row in the sample lists one cycle as a path: `["a.py", "b.py", "a.py"]` means `a.py` imports `b.py`, which imports `a.py`. The `hops` column is the cycle length — short cycles (2 hops, direct A↔B) are usually easier to break than long ones (3+ hops, fan through multiple modules).

**Typical resolutions**:
- Extract the shared types / constants into a new leaf module both can import
- Invert the dependency direction (dependency injection, event emitter, callback)
- Merge the two modules if they're genuinely that coupled

### False positives

- **Re-export barrels**: `__init__.py` / `index.ts` files that re-export symbols from the module directory can form cycles with their submodules. Indexer treats them as first-class files; the cycle is real but mostly harmless. Consider refactoring to a dedicated barrel (`_exports.py`) that doesn't import from the submodules.
- **Conditional imports under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`**: the parser records these as regular imports. If the cycle only exists at type-check time (never at runtime), it's less urgent — but still worth refactoring since the types are coupled.

---

## 2. `cross_package`

### What it detects

Imports that cross a forbidden package boundary. The default set has one pair:

```python
CROSS_PACKAGE_PAIRS = [
    ("twenty-front", "twenty-server"),
]
```

Any `:File` in `twenty-front` that imports from `:File` in `twenty-server` is a violation:

```cypher
MATCH (a:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(b:File)
WHERE a.package = 'twenty-front' AND b.package = 'twenty-server'
RETURN a.path AS importer, b.path AS importee
```

### Why it matters

Frontend and backend have different runtimes, different bundlers, different security models. Importing backend code into the frontend either breaks the build or (worse) leaks server-only secrets into the client bundle. The rule is a hard boundary — if you need to share something, extract it to a shared package (`twenty-types`, `twenty-shared`).

### Extending the rule set

Edit `codegraph/codegraph/arch_check.py` and append tuples to `CROSS_PACKAGE_PAIRS`:

```python
CROSS_PACKAGE_PAIRS = [
    ("twenty-front", "twenty-server"),
    ("packages/docs", "packages/twenty-server"),   # docs must not import from app
    ("packages/twenty-types", "packages/twenty-server"),  # shared types must be leaf
]
```

Every pair becomes an additional violation bucket. The report aggregates them so CI output stays compact.

### Interpreting a violation

`importer` is the file that broke the rule; `importee` is the file it shouldn't have reached. `importer_package` / `importee_package` tell you which boundary was crossed (useful once you have multiple rules).

**Typical resolutions**:
- Move the needed symbol into a shared leaf package both sides can import from
- Duplicate the constant or type (if it's small and stable — accept the minor drift cost)
- Replace the direct import with an HTTP call if the boundary is actually runtime, not build-time

### False positives

- **Auto-generated files**: a codegen step that writes generated types into the wrong package directory can trip this. Either fix the codegen target dir, or exclude generated files by `path` pattern before indexing.
- **Monorepo tooling**: if Turborepo / Nx / Lerna creates symlinks between packages, the indexer may follow them. Check that your `.codegraphignore` excludes `node_modules` and symlink-dense directories.

---

## 3. `layer_bypass`

### What it detects

Controllers that reach a `*Repository` method within 3 hops of `CALLS` without traversing a `*Service`:

```cypher
MATCH (ctrl:Controller)-[:HAS_METHOD]->(m:Method)-[:CALLS*1..3]->(target:Method)
MATCH (repo:Class)-[:HAS_METHOD]->(target)
WHERE repo.name ENDS WITH 'Repository'
  AND NOT EXISTS {
    MATCH (ctrl)-[:HAS_METHOD]->(:Method)-[:CALLS*1..3]->(:Method)<-[:HAS_METHOD]-(svc:Class)
    WHERE svc.name ENDS WITH 'Service'
  }
RETURN ctrl.name AS controller, repo.name AS repository, target.name AS method
```

### Why it matters

The Controller → Service → Repository layering is the default pattern in NestJS and most backend frameworks for a reason. Services are where business rules, validation, transaction boundaries, and cross-cutting concerns (auditing, caching, authorization) live. When a Controller talks to a Repository directly, all of that is bypassed — and the bypass usually stays hidden until someone needs to add one of those concerns and has to audit every call site.

### Interpreting a violation

`controller` is the class with a HAS_METHOD → CALLS chain into a Repository. `repository` is which Repository it reached. `method` is the specific repo method called. The violation is "controller X short-circuits directly to repo Y to call Z".

**Typical resolutions**:
- Introduce a `*Service` between the Controller and the Repository if one doesn't exist
- Move the call site from the Controller into an existing Service
- If the Controller really does need direct Repository access (e.g. a health-check endpoint reading `_metadata`), document it explicitly and either suppress by renaming or refine the policy

### False positives

- **Naming-convention-only detection**: this policy is a name-based heuristic. A project using `*Manager`, `*Handler`, or `*Facade` as its service layer won't match the `ENDS WITH 'Service'` check. Fork the module and rename to match.
- **Health checks / liveness probes**: a Controller calling `repository.countAll()` to prove the DB is reachable is a legitimate bypass. Consider renaming the repository method (`__healthcheck_countAll`), moving the check into a dedicated `HealthService`, or excluding that Controller by name.
- **Pure read endpoints with no business rules**: if an endpoint genuinely does nothing but read and return, inserting a pass-through Service adds ceremony without value. Accept the one-off violation or relax the policy to only fire on write operations.

## 4. `coupling_ceiling`

### What it detects

Files with more than N distinct file-level imports. A file that `:IMPORTS` many other files has high fan-out — it depends on a wide surface area and is likely a coupling magnet:

```cypher
MATCH (f:File)-[:IMPORTS]->(g:File)
WITH f, count(g) AS deps
WHERE deps > $threshold
RETURN f.path AS file, deps
ORDER BY deps DESC
```

### Why it matters

High fan-out files are expensive: every change to any of their dependencies is a potential break. They're hard to test in isolation, hard to move between packages, and hard to reason about. They tend to accumulate more imports over time (gravity effect) because "it already imports everything, so let's add one more". Catching them early — before they cross 20-30 imports — is much cheaper than untangling them later.

### Interpreting a violation

`file` is the path of the offending file. `deps` is how many distinct files it imports. The violation is "this file depends on `deps` other files, which exceeds the configured ceiling of `max_imports`".

**Typical resolutions**:
- Split the file into smaller, focused modules with narrower dependency sets
- Extract a facade or mediator that aggregates the imports, so consumers depend on the facade instead of N direct imports
- Check if some imports are unused and can be removed (the indexer counts all `import` statements, including dead ones)
- For barrel / re-export files (`__init__.py`, `index.ts`), consider raising the threshold or disabling the policy for that specific file pattern via a custom policy override

### Configuration

```toml
[policies.coupling_ceiling]
enabled     = true   # false disables this policy entirely
max_imports = 20     # flag files with more than this many distinct IMPORTS edges
```

Default threshold is 20. Raise it for large monorepo roots or barrel files; lower it for microservice repos where tight coupling matters more.

### False positives

- **Barrel / re-export files**: `__init__.py` and `index.ts` files exist to re-export symbols from submodules. A package `__init__.py` that re-exports 25 submodules will trip the default threshold, but that's its job. Raise `max_imports` or disable the policy if your project relies on deep barrel files.
- **Test files**: integration test files often import many modules under test plus fixtures. They're not production coupling magnets. Consider raising the threshold or adding a custom policy that excludes `tests/` paths.
- **Generated files**: auto-generated code (e.g. GraphQL resolvers, ORM models) can legitimately import many dependencies. Exclude them via `.codegraphignore` before indexing.

---

## Exit codes

`codegraph arch-check` returns:
- **0** — every policy passed.
- **1** — one or more policies reported violations.

CI job fails on non-zero. Report artifact (`arch-report.json`) is always uploaded, even on failure, so you can inspect the samples without re-running.

## Configuring policies — `.arch-policies.toml`

Every policy (built-in or custom) is tunable via a `.arch-policies.toml` file at the repo root. Missing file → all built-in defaults. `codegraph init` scaffolds a starter template.

Full schema:

```toml
[meta]
schema_version = 1   # required in future versions; omit for v1 (backwards compatible)

# ── Built-in policies: tune or disable ─────────────────────────

[policies.import_cycles]
enabled  = true   # false disables this policy entirely
min_hops = 2      # minimum cycle length (must be >= 2)
max_hops = 6      # maximum cycle length to detect

[policies.cross_package]
enabled = true
pairs = [
  { importer = "apps/web",    importee = "apps/api" },
  { importer = "packages/ui", importee = "packages/server" },
]

[policies.layer_bypass]
enabled           = true
controller_labels = ["Controller"]   # Neo4j labels to match as controllers
repository_suffix = "Repository"      # class name suffix for repos
service_suffix    = "Service"         # class name suffix for the required intermediate layer
call_depth        = 3                  # max CALLS hops to traverse

[policies.coupling_ceiling]
enabled     = true   # false disables this policy entirely
max_imports = 20     # flag files importing more than this many distinct files

# ── Custom policies: user-authored Cypher ──────────────────────

[[policies.custom]]
name          = "no_fat_files"
description   = "Files over 500 LOC"
count_cypher  = "MATCH (f:File) WHERE f.loc > 500 RETURN count(f) AS v"
sample_cypher = "MATCH (f:File) WHERE f.loc > 500 RETURN f.path AS file, f.loc AS loc LIMIT 10"
enabled       = true   # optional, defaults to true

[[policies.custom]]
name          = "no_dead_endpoints"
description   = "Endpoints without a HANDLES method"
count_cypher  = "MATCH (e:Endpoint) WHERE NOT EXISTS { (:Method)-[:HANDLES]->(e) } RETURN count(e) AS v"
sample_cypher = "MATCH (e:Endpoint) WHERE NOT EXISTS { (:Method)-[:HANDLES]->(e) } RETURN e.path AS route LIMIT 10"
```

### Rules
- Every section is optional. Omit to use defaults.
- Every `count_cypher` must return a single row with column `v` containing an integer ≥ 0.
- Every `sample_cypher` should return at most 10 rows — each row becomes a dict in the JSON report's `sample` array.
- Custom policy names must be unique and must not collide with built-in names (`import_cycles`, `cross_package`, `layer_bypass`, `coupling_ceiling`).
- Malformed TOML or invalid fields → exit code 2 with a clear error message (not exit code 1, which means policy violations).

### Schema versioning

The `[meta]` section carries metadata about the config file itself. Currently the only field is `schema_version`:

- **Omitted or `1`**: current schema, fully supported.
- **Greater than supported**: `codegraph arch-check` exits with code 2 and a message telling you which codegraph version to upgrade to.
- **`0` or negative**: rejected as invalid.

Existing `.arch-policies.toml` files without `[meta]` continue to work — they're treated as version 1.

### Worked examples by repo shape

**Full-stack monorepo (Next.js + NestJS)** — front must never import from server:
```toml
[policies.cross_package]
pairs = [
  { importer = "apps/web", importee = "apps/server" },
]
```

**Pure Python service** — no NestJS controllers, disable the layer-bypass policy:
```toml
[policies.layer_bypass]
enabled = false

[[policies.custom]]
name          = "no_views_calling_models_directly"
description   = "Django views should go through a service"
count_cypher  = "MATCH (:Class {name:'View'})-[:HAS_METHOD]->(:Method)-[:CALLS]->(:Method)<-[:HAS_METHOD]-(m:Class) WHERE m.name ENDS WITH 'Model' RETURN count(m) AS v"
sample_cypher = "MATCH (v:Class {name:'View'})-[:HAS_METHOD]->(:Method)-[:CALLS]->(:Method)<-[:HAS_METHOD]-(m:Class) WHERE m.name ENDS WITH 'Model' RETURN v.name AS view, m.name AS model LIMIT 10"
```

**Shared types package** — must be leaf (no outbound imports to any app):
```toml
[policies.cross_package]
pairs = [
  { importer = "packages/types", importee = "apps/web" },
  { importer = "packages/types", importee = "apps/server" },
  { importer = "packages/types", importee = "services/worker" },
]
```

## Exit codes

`codegraph arch-check` returns:
- **0** — every policy passed.
- **1** — one or more policies reported violations.
- **2** — `.arch-policies.toml` is malformed or semantically invalid.

CI job fails on any non-zero exit. The `arch-report.json` artifact is always uploaded on violations (exit 1); config errors (exit 2) are surfaced in the step log.

## Adding a policy you can't express in the built-ins

1. **First try a custom policy** — `[[policies.custom]]` with raw Cypher. Covers ~80% of real extensions.
2. **If Cypher isn't enough** — fork `codegraph/codegraph/arch_check.py`, add a new `_check_<name>(driver, cfg)` function, wire it into `_run_all`. Worth it when the policy needs multi-step state (e.g. cross-query aggregation, custom sampling) or Python logic that doesn't round-trip through Cypher.
